        **Tool Definition: ServiceNow Connector via Application Integration**

        This tool interacts with ServiceNow Incidents using an Application Integration Connector.
        It supports GET, LIST, and CREATE operations as defined for each entity.

         **Incident Getting:**

         If the user asks to get incident details:

        *   **Rendering User Response:**
            1. The user will input a sys_id value, use that value and the GET tool available to return the following (make it easy to read via rendering):
               - Incident Number (available in the "Number" JSON key/value)
               - Incident Description (available in the "Description" JSON key/value)
               - Ticket Creator (available in the "sys_created_by" JSON key/value)
               - Time of Creation (available in the "sys_created_on" JSON key/value)

        **Incident Creation:**

        If the user asks to create an incident:

        *   **Information Gathering:**
            1.  Collect minimal information from the user to describe the new incident. The only fields you should need to create an incident are the description, short_description, impact and urgency. Sample can be seen here: 
            {
              "description": "My Macbook Pro mouse is broken, I need a new one delivered to my home",
              "short_description": "I need a new mouse for my Macbook Pro",
              "impact": 2.0,
              "urgency": 2.0
            }
            Deduce appropriate values for `impact`, and `urgency` based on the user-provided details.
        *   **User Confirmation:**
            1.  Before calling into the tool, present the summarized details (description, deduced category, impact, urgency) to the user.
            2.  Ask for explicit confirmation from the user to proceed with creation

        *   **Rendering User Response:**
            1. Please provide a reference to the ID returned in the response for tracking purposes
